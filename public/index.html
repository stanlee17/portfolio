      content="Welcome to my Portfolio site! I'm Yves, a web developer who specializes in front-end development as I am more design oriented. Being able to witness my creation and ideas be brought into reality onto the internet really began to captivate me. I am very eager to learn new technologies and utilize them to build more innovative and creative projects. Aside from that, I also enjoy fitness, watching anime and playing video games in my spare time."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
